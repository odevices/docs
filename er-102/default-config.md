; The ER-102 Configuration File
; (generated by v2.23 firmware)
; 
; This file must adhere to the format of INI files.  Refer to:
;     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file
; for more details on this format.
;
; Feel free to edit this file.  To restore this file to its default contents just
; delete, rename, or move this file.  The ER-102 will generate a new clean file
; the next time it loads your SD card and sees that there is no CONFIG.ini file.

[General]
; Select the units for the note display.
;
; chromatic | cents

; SD card driver tweaks
;
; Warning: The recommended setting is 'robust' because the 'fast' mode is known
; to not work on some cards.  So please test.

;
; disabled | last-loaded | last-saved | last-accessed
; Important: Use 'disabled' or 'last-saved' if you need fast snapshot loading times.

[Parts]
; Select the USER transition type.
;
; immediate - The next part starts playing immediately.
; focus - The next part plays when the focused track, pattern, or step is finished.
; clock - The next part plays on the next clock pulse.
; track-1 - The next part plays when track 1 finishes.
; track-2 - The next part plays when track 2 finishes.
; track-3 - The next part plays when track 3 finishes.
; track-4 - The next part plays when track 4 finishes.

[Real-time Recording]
; Remote punch in/out behavior.
;
; edge - A rising edge toggles from punch in to punch out and back.
; level - A high signal punches in and a low signal punches out.
; edge-or-first - Same as 'edge' except a rising edge on AD-1 will also punch in.
;                 This is useful for punching in on the first note played.

; Assign unused inputs.
;
; smooth-A - (de)activates CV-A smoothing on the step just recorded.

;
; true | false

; Automatically assign newly recorded material to which part?
;
; active - assign to the active part

; always: Hold output cv whenever gate is zero.
