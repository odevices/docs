These are the units that are built into the firmware.  They cannot be uninstalled or replaced because the base system requires them for certain operations.

If you are looking for the rest of the factory-installed units then please refer to:

* [Core Package](/er-301/core-pkg)
* [Teletype Package](/er-301/teletype-pkg)
