As of v0.3.06 of the ER-301 firmware and teletype firmware v2.3, there is support for teletype to control the ER-301 over the i2c bus.  There is a discussion thread over on the forum dedicated to this topic:

[Forum thread on teletype integration](https://forum.orthogonaldevices.com/t/i2c-communication-with-monome-teletype/743)

This package provides the units that enable the ER-301 to be controlled over the I2C bus using the monome teletype protocol.
