The ER-301 essentially implements a programming language for sound.  Unlike a fixed-architecture synthesizer, this manual cannot describe everything that you can do with it.  Instead this manual describes the available building blocks *individually* and how to connect the building blocks *in general* (i.e. flow control).  A limited set of illustrative examples is also given to tie the concepts together in a concrete manner.  The rest is left up to the user, the community, and the will to experiment.

So fire up your abstraction-loving prefrontal cortex and let's get started!
