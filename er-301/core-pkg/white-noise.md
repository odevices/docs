## Overview

This unit outputs (bipolar) white noise at full-scale, -1 to 1.  The white noise is generated using a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) called [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister), one of the most commonly used PRNG.

Some applications are:
* A source of wildly fluctuating random values.
* Drum synthesis (particularly hihats)
* Exciting a filter across the entire spectrum.
* Pretending you are in a tropical rainstorm.
* Searching for signs of a higher being.
