## Overview

This unit outputs [pink noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise) at full-scale.  Pink noise differs from white noise in that its power is equally distributed over octaves whereas white noise is equally distributed over frequency.  As a result, the sound of pink noise is less overwhelmed by high frequency and tends to rumble where white noise hisses.  Pink noise is more often encountered in nature than white noise.  The pink noise here is generated using the [Voss-McCartney algorithm](https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/908.php).

Some applications are:
* A source of naturally random values.
* Drum synthesis (particularly snares) or other kinds of physical synthesis.
* Thunder, wind, and waterfalls.
